# C++ Tutorial for Engineers

## About

This tutorial is a work in progress and is a bit of an experiment.  It may help to explain what this is all about if I describe who I am and my motivation in writing this.

I am a programmer by experience.  By that I mean that I have no formal training in computer science.  On the other hand, I love coding and have been doing it for a long time; I've worked on enough projects and on projects of sufficient complexity that I've had to learn a lot of these ideas out of necessity.

My background is engineering.  Specifically, mechanical engineering by way of electrical engineering, and in the end basically just a lot of applied mathematics.  If you care to know, my graduate research was in the area of cooperative robotics.

Like every undergraduate engineer, I had to take an introduction computer science course.  Mine was in Matlab and C++, but I think Java is also popular.  Either way, the emphasis of that course was on the very basic ideas of writing computer programs: variables, flow structures, etc.  The idea was to teach people just enough to be able to use programming to solve basic engineering problems, and to have some idea what *kinds* of problems can be solved by writing a computer program.  Object oriented programming may have been mentioned, but probably not until the last week of class and only a flavor.
