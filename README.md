# A C++ Tutorial for Engineers

by Dan Swain, dan.t.swain@gmail.com

## About

This tutorial is a work in progress and is a bit of an experiment. 

This tutorial might be for you if

 - You're smart and have *some* programming experience in any language - you know how to use variables, if/then/else, for loops, etc.
 - You don't have a lot of experience working with compiled languages like C and C++
 - You want to understand ideas from object oriented programming and use them to tackle large and complex projects.
 
I say this tutorial is for 'engineers' because, in my experience, they largely fit that description.  Except software engineers, but who's a software engineer that's searching for a C++ tutorial? :P  Anyways, I'm hoping that it's applicable to lots of people.

This is also a bit of an experiment in that I'm writing it as a [github](http://github.com) repository.  I'm writing the text in markdown files (which GH automatically formats for display) and will try to attach actual pieces of code where I can.  That way, you can clone the repository and play along.
